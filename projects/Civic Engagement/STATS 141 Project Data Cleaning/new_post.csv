The demographic differs as I saw much more homeless, low income people around Little Tokyo. Additionally, most of the families utilizing the afterschool program lived in the ""affordable housing"" program provided by the Little Tokyo Service Center. Secondly, the diversity in the environment was very apparent to me as streets became narrower and many more businesses and buildings surrounded/ almost crowded the streets. Overall, my knowledge of diversity expanded after realizing the very different day to day lives everyone lives and the variety of realities that people experience. At first reading the word ""diversity,"" I thought of race, but race was not something that stuck out to me as both the Beverly Hills and downtown parts of LA were made up of people of all races/ ethnicities.","This quarter I contributed to the Little Tokyo Service Center by helping out/volunteering at their Mi CASA afterschool program. There was usually only one or two other staff members, so I think being there, I helped take some kids off of their hands. Especially being in college and still having a lot of energy, I was able to play with multiple kids in the gym and engage in a variety of sport/ active activities with them. I was also able to form meaningful connections with a few of the kids at the program since I would go at the same time and day each week. Not only did I engage in different activities with the kids, but I assisted them with homework and made sure they were safe at all times. Before the kids arrived, I helped set up the room for the program; and, after the kids left, I would help clean up the room and put any books, drawing materials, basketballs, etc.. back to where they belong."
