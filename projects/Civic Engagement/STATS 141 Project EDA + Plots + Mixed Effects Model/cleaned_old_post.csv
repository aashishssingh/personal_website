Because of this, there is no one specific way of working towards a solution.

However, upstream solutions target disparities lying at the foundation of these issues---ones that can only fully be resolved by acknowledging the overarching inequities and histories that accompany them.

I understood its value in principle, but didn't truly comprehend its depth and impact. However, my experiences transformed my understanding in profound ways.

I realized that many people living in my own neighborhood were struggling with food security, something I'd previously been unaware of. This opened my eyes to the hidden realities many of my fellow community members face and spurred me to action. Through these experiences, my attitude shifted from passive resident to active community member. I learned that every contribution, no matter how small, can make a difference.

Talking to them enriched my thinking and made the findings more diverse. Secondly, during the collection of materials, I have a deeper understanding of bicycles. Such as different types of bikes, different types of bike gear and various clubs, it opened my eyes to the diversity of the cycling community. In the end, getting involved in community work shattered my stereotypes. It made me realize that like any sport, cycling is for everyone, regardless of age, gender, race or physical ability.","Through my coursework participation this semester, I have become more inclusive of how my local community engages."

Working with my community partner, I've learned that people who need aid, specifically mental health resources, come from all walks of life and socioeconomic degrees, and working with my non-profit organization has revealed the diversity of issues that BIPOC individuals deal with daily that aren't being addressed.","I've always felt this tenacity to get more involved in organizations that directly help underserved communities, and being in this class has immensely amplified my drive to invest my time/efforts in providing resources for the communities around me. In psychology specifically, I want to focus my future work on marginalized communities where mental wellness is heavily stigmatized, and this class has helped me learn where I can get started in this venture."

In the case of Esperanza Community Housing their differences in language, in home country, in skills, in past careers, in education are what truly makes Esperanza diverse. Diversity needs more than one or two criteria. To effectively make change, represent ,and engage a community we need to take the time to invite all walks of diversity rather than what meets the eye.","One thing I learned is that I can never stop learning how to better engage my local communities. Dissecting frameworks and case study’s allows not only for a more structured approach to community engagement but receipting on areas of improvement. There is no one right way to engage a community rather it’s more specific and catered to the specific issue etc. It is really an every changing process and I learned to keep that mindset."

The program that I worked with had me engage with kids from these areas, which led to a considerable amount of reflection, as childhood is at the core of every person.","My experiences in this class, most importantly, exposed me to the ways in which I could engage my local communities, as I have had few experiences working with organizations in the past.
