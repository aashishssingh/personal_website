Additionally, we addressed BookSustain's funding challenges by conducting research and presenting them with various methods and strategies to generate revenue. These included innovative approaches such as auctioning off signed books by renowned authors, seeking grants and donations, and exploring avenues like selling books on third-party platforms like Amazon.These are a few of the strategies we presented to BookSustain, and they are likely to have a lasting impact on their operations and the community they serve, promoting access to knowledge and increasing the literacy rate in the Los Angeles area."
